# Evil Santa Overview

This is a game made using Godot that I, along with three others, worked on over the course of roughly three months. This is the Alpha demo build, which we demo'd around Christmas.
It is a top-down RPG featuring weapon collection, boss battles, and a developing story. It has three boss fights and a handful of levels, mostly as a proof of concept for the design.
This was ported over from a group repo and brought here for your viewing pleasure.

## My Contribution
I largely focused on game design. I made a lot of the decisions regarding scope and the ideas present in the game. I was also entirely responsible for the UI and UX in the game in order to make it easy to understand and quick to pick up.
I also did some scripting involving the enemey AI as well as certain mechanics of non-boss enemies. I helped with the level design including placement of props, enemies, and spawn locations.
Overall I was happy with this Alpha build, and our alpha testers were interested in it enough to keep playing to the end. I got to learn a decent bit about challenge and game design in general.
